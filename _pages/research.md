  <h2>Interactive ML for large language models</h2>
  <p>
    Our recent research focus is to study IML problems that arise from large language models, including alignment, post-training, reasoning, and test-time scaling — viewing a model's generated outputs as <em>actions</em> and bringing IML tools to bear on them. 
    We are currently developing efficient algorithms inspired by learning theory and evaluating them on real-world tasks.
    Some of these efforts are in collaboration with <a href="https://www.krafton.ai/en/">Krafton AI</a>.

We study bandit algorithms and other online decision-making problems, where an agent's decisions are
actions that shape which data or feedback it receives next — balancing exploration of uncertain options
against exploiting what already works well.

<h2>Reinforcement learning and bandits</h2>
<p>
  We develop efficient algorithms for reinforcement learning and bandit problems, with an emphasis on rigorous theoretical guarantees.
  The multi-armed/contextual bandit problem can be viewed as a special case of reinforcement learning with no states.
  No, this does not mean existing RL algorithms are efficient in the bandit setting -- algorithms designed for bandits typically work much better.
  Bandit algorithms have been deployed in real-world systems, including online news recommendation at Microsoft (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03966">paper link</a>) and large-scale experimentation and A/B testing at Meta Platforms.
  Our research on bandits is funded in part by Meta Platforms, with whom we maintain an ongoing research collaboration.

<h2>Learning theory</h2>
<p>
  We develop learning-theoretic tools for designing statistically efficient machine learning algorithms. 
  Our work spans both general learning theory, including methods that adapt to favorable properties of the data such as low noise, and practical confidence bounds for quantifying statistical uncertainty. 
  These ideas often serve as key building blocks for efficient algorithms in bandits, reinforcement learning, and other interactive learning problems.
